Based on the SWOT analysis, two strategies can be used to help Green Zebra capture an opportunity in the market place and address a competitive threat. Green Zebra can harness its strong brand identity and commitment to health and wellness to capture the rising market demand for organic and natural food options. With urban consumer consumers increasingly seeking healthier food options. Green Zebra’s unique positioning as a hybrid between a high-end grocery store and a convenience store can facilitate it to effectively tap into this trend. Green Zebra can also expand its products offering and enhance its marketing efforts by highlighting the health benefits and quality of its products and this will increase and attract more health-conscious urbanites.  The store can also seek partnership with local organic farms and health-focused brands to solidify its reputation and widen the range of products it offers which is a move that can steer the growing demand for healthy organic food options in the urban space.

To counter the competitive threat posed by technologically advanced rivals like Amazon Go, Green Zebra should address its current technological limitations. This can be done through integration of better technologies such as mobile payments options, loyalty apps, and enhanced online ordering systems, where Green Zebra which can improve the overall customer experience and streamline operations. In doing this, Green Zebra can mitigate its weaknesses but also align with customer expectations for convenience and efficiency. Green Zebra should also invest in data analytics to help it understand customer’s preferences and tailor its offering accordingly.  
Porter’s Five Forces (Forbes, 2024) framework can help Green Zebra in building a convenience store and a health-focused Grocery store under the following rationales;
(i)	Threat of New Entrants.
The store has low barrier to entry given the relatively low startup costs and straightforward business models but faces threat from established brands such as 7-Eleven that have a better customer’s loyalty and economies of scale that can deter new entrants. Higher barriers to entry can be occasioned by need for specialized knowledge, sourcing of organic products in areas where it is difficult to find and the cost implication for health standards. 
(ii)	Bargaining Power of Suppliers
Convenience store require multiple suppliers for a wide range of products , however need for special items leads to low suppliers who may then demand more money for products they supply. Healthy focused groceries on the other hand has higher risk given the supplier may demand premium price.
(iii)	Bargaining Power of Buyers
The customers can easily locate or switch to other convenience store given price sensitivity is significant. 
(iv)	Threat of Substitute Products and Services
This is high risk given the fact that numerous alternative such as supermarkets and discount stores may offer organic products that do not meet the standards 
(v)	Rivalry among Existing Competitors
This may be high but differentiated due to existence of players such as 7-Eleven who would influence competition in terms of convenience, price and quality of products.

With COVID, most business were fundamentally altered including their customers behavior and therefore imperative that G adapts to these changes to sustain and grow their business through a comprehensive approach as follows.
(i)	Emphasize online and Omni-channel Presence
With Covid-19 most business shifted to offering an online shopping experience to their customers in order to meet demand and stay competitive. Green Zebra can develop a robust e-commerce platform that will allow customers to browse and purchase organic and healthy products from their comfort. This can also be complimented by introduction of click-and –drop service to cater for those who prefer minimizing time spent in-store, thereby enhancing customer convenience and safety (Holly Briedis, 2020). Through partnerships with delivery services, GZ will expand its brand and reach ensuring that customers receive their orders promptly at their doorsteps. 
Another interventions would be on In-store health safety and convenience as it is understood that it can directly impact the consumer behavior in post-COVID era. G can implement advanced safety protocols like regular sanitization, mandatory masks for staff, and contactless payment options with reassurance to customers about the safety of shopping at Green Zebra (Lakshmanan Prakash, 2020). The store can also introduce self-checkout stations that can minimize the physical interactions and reduce wait times, thereby improving the overall shopping experience.  
Expanding of product offer to include fresh produce such as dairy and bakery items will attract environmentally conscious consumers as a way of promoting sustainability and attracting locally produced products. The strengthening of relationship with local suppliers will go a long way to ensuring steady supply of high quality products, support for local businesses and reduce supply chain disruptions as happened in 2020 COVID era. Finally, there is need to leverage technology and adapt data-driven marketing. In the post COVID marketplace, there is need to use technology as an essential tool for marketing and retention of customers.  This can be made possible through development of loyalty programs that rewards repeat purchases which would drive customer’s loyalty and increase sales.  Further there is need to promote personalized marketing approach through use of data  (Deloitte, 2016) which increases the conversion rates and revenue growth.  
5.	For the geographic expansion for Green Zebra, the firm would need information about the prospective markets through undertaking the following studies;
(i)	Market potential analysis 
The study aims to assess the demand for healthy, organic, and convenient food options across various prospective markets through demographic analysis, examining factors of age, income, and education levels. The consumer behavior in terms of preference and purchasing power in the target market would also be included in this study. 
(ii)	Competitor Analysis
This is essential for purpose of evaluating existing competition, players in the market and others including stores and grocery chains. The purpose for this would be to help identify market share, pricing strategies, and customer loyalty of competitors thereby giving insights into GZ on strategy to apply to differentiate itself from the rest (Forbes, 2024)
(iii)	Location Analysis
On this, Green Zebra will need to focus on the potential store locations looking into factors such as foot traffic, accessibility, proximity to competitors and costs relating to real estate. The purpose is to enable Green Zebra in selection of prime location that provides maximum visibility and convenience for the prospective customers 
(iv)	Economic and Sociocultural Analysis
By evaluating economic stability, growth prospects, and sociocultural factors of the target market, Green Zebra will have a better understanding of critical information such as median income and cultural attitude towards health and organic food in the prospect market. Other studies that are also important include the regulatory and legal framework that address food retail and the supply chain analysis to establish the efficiency of the local suppliers and entire logistical infrastructure that will be used for maintaining products 
Research Questions 
(i)	What is the current demand for healthy, organic and convenient food option in the target markets?
(ii)	What are the demographic characteristics of the population in these markets
(iii)	Who are the players in the target market and what are their strengths and weaknesses?
(iv)	How loyal are customers to the existing competitors?
(v)	What are the high foot traffic areas in the target markets?
(vi)	How accessible are the locations in terms of public transport and access to other facilities?
(vii)	What is the cultural attitude towards health and organic in the target market?
These are some of the research questions that should help Green Zebra in its goal of expanding to better strategic locations. Market demand and potential will be the most important strategic objective and priority should be given to areas with high demand for the food. Competitive Landscape is also another key factor where GZ should focus on regions with a lower competition or areas where it can easily differentiate itself (Porter 5). Economic Viability evaluation is also an important factor where GZ should focus on regions with strong economic indicators of high median income, low unemployment rates, and positive economic growth forecasts.  Additionally, regulatory ease and cultural alignment should inform Green Zebra the best environment it can locate to, preference should be given to business-friendly and low bureaucratic areas and regions where culture aligns with the mission of healthy organic food eating habits.
